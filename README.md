# rust_port_scanner
Command line port scanner made in Rust as a learning project. Could be runned on a public REPLIT repo.

I created the tool following along the article - newsletter of [KERKOUR](https://kerkour.com/rust-fast-port-scanner)
The tool can be runned on my public [Replit repository](https://replit.com/@carlo_/rustportscanner?v=1)
