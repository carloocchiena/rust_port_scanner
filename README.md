# rust_port_scanner
Command line port scanner made in Rust as a learning project. Could be runned on a public REPLIT repo. <br><br>

I created the tool following along the article - newsletter of [KERKOUR](https://kerkour.com/rust-fast-port-scanner)<br>
The tool can be runned on my public [Replit repository](https://replit.com/@carlo_/rustportscanner?v=1)

example: `$ cargo run -- google.com` 
<br>
In order to extract it as a runnable .exe file: <br>
`$ cargo clean`<br>
`$ cargo build --release`<br>
